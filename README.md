# DIY-Geiger-Counter-Detail
Some extended information of the DIY Geiger Counter sold online.

As I felt the provided info needed to reorganised a little, so that I could follow it easier, I made these files.

Added here is the slightly reorganised bill of materials, so that I can be searched in excel or other similar program.
Also is the layout of the PCB with the numbers overlayed to make it quicker to spot where to install parts.

I uploaded it here incase others might find it useful.
